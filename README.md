monster-maze
====
a simple tile based, puzzle game in C#... push bolders, dodge monsters, rewind time!

This was a collaborative effort between CharlieG(TransactCharlie) and myself.

Run the view test harness to play the game in the command console, or build your own view to experience the game how you please.

Test harness controls:

* up, down, left, right: w,s,a,d 
* rewind: r
* skip: space
